**Trust scores you can verify without seeing who contributed them.**

Privacy-preserving, cryptographically-backed Web of Trust for Nostr. LSAG ring-signature assertions built on NIP-85, with sub-identity compartmentalisation.

**Who is this for?** Nostr client developers building trust systems where contributor privacy matters — abuse reporting, whistleblowing, journalism, anonymous peer review. If your users can't afford to be identified when vouching for someone, this is the library.

## The Trust Trilemma

Today's NIP-85 trust scores ask you to pick two:

| Property    | NIP-85 today | nostr-veil |
|-------------|:---:|:---:|
| Verifiable  | ✓   | ✓  |
| Private     | ✗   | ✓  |
| Portable    | ✓   | ✓  |

Anyone who can see the assertions can see exactly who judged you. That works fine for benign social signals. It fails completely the moment the subject matter is sensitive — abuse reporting, whistleblowing, political dissent. The people who need Web of Trust most are the ones who cannot afford to be identified.

nostr-veil solves all three. Assertions are standard NIP-85 events that any existing client can consume. Veil-aware clients can go further and verify the cryptographic proofs that back them.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NIP-85 foundation  (nostr-veil/nip85)                  │
│  Kind 30382–30385 assertion events + kind 10040         │
│  providers. Standard Nostr. Any client reads it.        │
└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                          │
┌─────────────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐
│  Proof layer  (nostr-veil/proof)                        │
│  LSAG ring signatures — each contributor signs          │
│  anonymously. Key images prove distinct signers.        │
│  K-of-N threshold verification without revealing K      │
│  individual identities.                                 │

│  compartmentalised personas. Contribute to a trust      │
│  circle as a derived key; prove common ownership        │

## Quick start

```
npm install nostr-veil
```

```ts
import { createTrustCircle, contributeAssertion, aggregateContributions, verifyProof } from 'nostr-veil'

// 1. Define the circle (three anonymous members)
const circle = createTrustCircle([alicePubkey, bobPubkey, carolPubkey])

// 2. Each member contributes independently — their identity is hidden inside the ring
const alice = contributeAssertion(circle, subjectPubkey, { followers: 820, rank: 74 }, alicePrivkey, 0)
const bob   = contributeAssertion(circle, subjectPubkey, { followers: 900, rank: 80 }, bobPrivkey,   1)

// 3. Aggregate into a standard NIP-85 kind 30382 event
const assertion = aggregateContributions(circle, subjectPubkey, [alice, bob])

// 4. Any client verifies — two distinct members agreed, no names attached
const result = verifyProof(assertion)
// { valid: true, circleSize: 3, threshold: 2, distinctSigners: 2, errors: [] }
```

The resulting `assertion` is a plain `EventTemplate` you sign and publish like any other Nostr event.

## Demo

The interactive demo walks through a whistleblower scenario: a trust circle vouches anonymously for a source, and an editor verifies the threshold without learning who contributed.

```
npm run demo
```

Opens a Vite dev server. Five screens: The Circle → The Source → The Veil → Verification → The Reveal.

## How it works

Each member of a trust circle calls `contributeAssertion` independently. Under the hood this calls `lsagSign` from `@forgesworn/ring-sig`, which produces a Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature over the canonical message `{ circleId, subject, metrics }`.

The published NIP-85 event carries three extra tags:

- `veil-ring` — the full set of member pubkeys (the ring)
- `veil-threshold` — how many contributions were aggregated out of how many members
- `veil-sig` (one per contribution) — the serialised LSAG signature and key image

A verifier calls `verifyProof`, which:

1. Reconstructs each LSAG signature against the ring
2. Confirms each signature is valid
3. Checks key images are distinct — proving each signer contributed at most once (LSAG linkability property)
4. Confirms the number of valid, distinct signatures meets the threshold

At no point does verification require knowing which member produced which signature. The ring is public. The identities of the actual signers are not.
